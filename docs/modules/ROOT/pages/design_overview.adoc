= Design Overview

lightway-core is a small, multi-platform, pure C library that encapsulates the
encryption and processing of IP packets.

On its own, lightway-core is not an executable application. Instead, it is a
*purposefully* simple library. Intentionally, lightway-core is opinionated
about how it works and the scope it controls, and very agnostic about
everything else. The core use case of this library is as part of a
high-performance, always-on VPN application, which necessarily entails
deferring items like "how do I actualy send UDP packets?" to the host
application, which can use the best API for the platform, be it a Windows
desktop or an iPhone.

== Terminology

Some people may prefer to see these terms in context, see <<What does it actually do?>>

Inside::
Refers to data that will be wrapped or has already been unwrapped by lightway-core.
Outside::
Refers to data wrapped by lightway-core
SSL Context::
lightway-core attributes that may be shared across multiple connections
Connection::
lightway-core attributes that reflect a single wrapped data path between a client<->server.

== What does it actually do?

At a very high-level, once a connection is established, lightway-core provides a bidirectional pathway for wrapping data in a way that can be securely sent over the internet.

One direction is the "inside path". The host application passes data to lightway-core for wrapping, and then lightway-core will call the host application's ``outside_write_cb`` one or more times with the appropriately encrypted data, which the host is then responsible for transmitting appropriately.footnote:[Where "appropriately" normally means "send these packets over the internet, client->server or server->client depending on which side of the connection we are on."]

The other direction is the "outside path". The host application passes data wrapped by lightway-core to the appropriate library function; lightway-core will then call the host application's ``inside_write_cb`` one or more times with the appropriately unwrapped data, which the host can then deliver appropriately.

Of course, the devil is in the details, and there are a lot of details here.
